== What's New in OpenNMS Horizon 21

=== System Requirements

=== Breaking Changes

* Property format change of `opennms.alarmTroubleTicketLinkTemplate`:
Originally the `opennms.alarmTroubleTicketLinkTemplate` defined in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties` requires the full `<a href="...">${id}</a>` link to be configured.
This is changed to the ticketer system url, e.g. `https://issues.opennms.org/browse/${id}` instead of `<a href="https://issues.opennms.org/browse/${id}">${id}</a>`.
If the `opennms.alarmTroubleTicketEnabled` is `true` then the `opennms.alarmTroubleTicketLinkTemplate` must be updated as well in order to not break the link to an external ticketing system on the Alarm Details Page.
